        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <h3>Through downloading the files and createing a google spreed sheet I was able to analysis the data present.</h3>
        <h3>Once loaded into google sheets I proceeded to make 3 graphs based on the releases in 2006, 2014, 2023 to</h3>
        <h3>get an idea on what the populartiy of games were based on their realese time in those years.</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>2006</h3>
                <img src="media/Data things 3.PNG" alt="Data showing highest player count for games in 2003 is in August">
                <p>This graph shows that in August is when the highest player count was not December. This could be the case</p>
                <p>do to the fact that is during the summer but this data set isn't giving the full picture as Steam was just invented</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>2014</h3>
                <img src="media/Data things 2.PNG" alt="Data howing highest player count for games in 2014 is in May and June">
                <p>This graph shows that in May and June is when the highest player count was. This is because that is summer</p>
                <p>and that is when a lot of people tend to play video games. This graph is more usseful as Steam had been around</p>
                <p>for a longer time frame so there are more users and more games being published to the platform</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>2023</h3>
                <img src="media/Data things.PNG" alt="Data howing highest player count for games in 2023 is in March">
                <p>This graph shows that in Match is when the highest player count is. This is do to that we are in currently</p>
                <p>living in 2023 and that is when the most games have realesed this year. This data is bigger than the pervious</p>
                <p>data sets due to Steams modern populartiy but only gives a window in what the player count is like this year</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results form the three years that were examined show that December is not when games are at their most popular</p>
        <p>but instead summer and times around there tend to be.</p>
